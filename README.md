## Your Air Quality Monitoring Expert :thumbsup:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Airpuff is a specially designed app that provides real-time air quality information, displaying the Air Quality Index (AQI) and other crucial environmental data for your area. Additionally, it allows you to check air quality data for different cities, helping you plan your travels well in advance. Currently under development, the app is expected to feature a user-friendly interface and powerful functionalities. It will be able to show levels of key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, and will include air quality forecasts, historical data trend analysis, and personalized health recommendations. Whether you are an outdoor sports enthusiast or a parent deeply concerned about air quality, Airpuff aims to intelligently adjust your daily activities to ensure a healthy life for you and your family.

<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interface provides a comprehensive search function that allows you to inquire about the air quality data and related indexes of any city you're interested in. It also offers pertinent travel advice based on the current conditions. Additionally, you can utilize the charts to observe the anticipated data fluctuations for the coming days, which include the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) and the variations in specific pollutants like ozone and PM2.5. With this information at your disposal, you can plan your travels wisely and stay informed about your environment.
