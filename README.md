## Your Air Quality Monitoring Expert :thumbsup:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Airpuff is a specially designed app that provides real-time air quality information, displaying the Air Quality Index (AQI) and other crucial environmental data for your area. Additionally, it allows you to check air quality data for different cities, helping you plan your travels well in advance. Currently under development, the app is expected to feature a user-friendly interface and powerful functionalities. It will be able to show levels of key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, and will include air quality forecasts, historical data trend analysis, and personalized health recommendations. Whether you are an outdoor sports enthusiast or a parent deeply concerned about air quality, Airpuff aims to intelligently adjust your daily activities to ensure a healthy life for you and your family.
